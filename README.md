## üìñ Overview

This project is a fork of [dalelane/scratch-extension-development](https://github.com/dalelane/scratch-extension-development) repurposed to create a Scratch extension that:

- Adds an **‚ÄúAsk AI‚Äù** block in the Scratch block palette  
- Sends a user-typed question to a GPT-4o-mini LLM API endpoint  
- Returns the AI‚Äôs response back into Scratch for display or further use

It‚Äôs been built as part of a competition entry to show initiative and to give Grade¬†1 students a fun way to practice subjects with the support from AI/LLM for explaination. I have a sample `.sb3` project demonstrates the extension in action:

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Scratch 3.0 UI] -->|Ask AI block| B[Extension Runtime : JS]
  B -->|HTTP POST question| C[LLM API: GPT-4o-mini on Azure]
  C -->|JSON response| B
  B -->|Return text| A
```

1. **Scratch 3.0 UI**  
   - User drags the **‚ÄúAsk AI‚Äù** block into their script.  
2. **Extension Runtime** (`your-scratch-extension/index.js`)  
   - Listens for the block event, captures the question string.  
   - Sends an authenticated `fetch()` request to the LLM API.  
   - Parses the JSON response and resolves it back to Scratch as a string.  
3. **LLM API**  
   - A simple REST endpoint (`API_BASE_URL`) protected by `API_KEY`.  
   - Internally forwards the prompt to the GPT-4o-mini model and returns the answer.

## üîó Open Source & Custom Development

- **Based on**  
  - [dalelane/scratch-extension-development](https://github.com/dalelane/scratch-extension-development): starter template, build scripts, and the demo HTML wrapper.  
  - Scratch‚Äôs unofficial extension loader in the offline editor.

- **My Own Work**  
  - **`your-scratch-extension/index.js`**: customized to call to and LLM endpoint and handle block‚Äôs logic.
  - **Azure Endpoint Setup**: Designing and deploying a custom LLM API endpoint on Azure, including OpenAI resource provisioning and Azure Functions integration.  
  - **`.sb3` Project**: custom Scratch project that uses the ‚ÄúAsk AI‚Äù block to quiz topics for elementary-level students(math problems, English, fun facts).  
  - **Live Deployment**: GitHub Pages setup under `/vui-hoc-cung-AI/scratch/` including a friendly UI wrapper (`src/index.html`) for non-technical users.  
  - **Documentation & Demo**: this README, automated build & deploy scripts, and demo link.

## üí° Skills 
This project showcases my ability to:
- **Game Design**: Creating a multi-level .sb3 Scratch game that guides Grade 1 students through progressively challenging exercises in different subjects math, English, etc.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e74e28d4-dc70-474a-a0f1-3e934fc6bc57)

- **Deploy Azure LLM Endpoint**: Implementing Azure Functions to wrap the LLM API.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dabc548-5bcb-4fbb-bbe9-c75747713bcd)

- **LLM Prompt Design**: Crafting prompts and parsing responses to ensure questions and answers are clear and engaging for elementary students.
- **UI Integration**: Learning how Scratch‚Äôs block rendering works, modifying `index.html`, and ensuring her extension loaded seamlessly in the Scratch UI.
- **Event Handling**: Writing JavaScript to listen for block events and pass data between Scratch and the extension runtime.  
- **Deployment Workflow**: Use automated scripts (defined in the original repo) for build, and publishing to GitHub Pages.



## üåê Extensibility & Collaboration
This GitHub Pages site and extension template are designed for everyone to build upon:

- **Add New Scratch Blocks**: Easily extend the Scratch palette by modifying src/extension.js to register additional LLM-powered blocks.
- **Customize Prompts**: Tailor prompts in the Azure Function (or your own API) to create new educational activities or storytelling experiences.
- **Fork & Share**: Clone this repo, create your own branches of extensions, and share them back via pull requests or GitHub Pages deployments.
- **Community Projects**: Encourage peers to contribute fun applications‚Äîgames, quizzes, interactive stories‚Äîthat leverage LLM APIs for dynamic content.

Use this as a launchpad to explore AI in Scratch and collaborate on innovative learning tools!

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Development

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thuytien-binhthuan/vui-hoc-cung-AI.git
cd vui-hoc-cung-AI
```

### 2. Provision & build
```bash
# Install prerequisites (once)
./0-setup.sh

# Add or update npm deps
./1-add-dependency.sh

# Compile & bundle extension
./2-build.sh

# Run a local dev server
./3-run-private.sh

# Publish to GitHub Pages
./4-publish.sh
```

### 3. Create a Custom LLM API Endpoint on Azure

If you prefer to host your own LLM endpoint using Azure, follow these steps:

1. **Provision an Azure OpenAI Resource**  
   - In the Azure Portal, click **Create a resource ‚Üí AI + Machine Learning ‚Üí Azure OpenAI**.  
   - Select your subscription, resource group, region, and pricing tier.  
   - Wait for deployment to complete.  
2. **Deploy an Azure Function**  
   - Create a **Function App** (Compute ‚Üí Function App) and choose a runtime (Node.js or Python).  
   - In the Functions blade, add a new HTTP-triggered function.  
3. **Implement Your Handler**  
   - Read the incoming `question` from the request body.  
   - Construct a child-friendly prompt, e.g.:  
     ```js
     const prompt = `You are a friendly tutor for Grade 1 students.

Student asks: "${question}"

Answer:`;
     ```  
   - Call the Azure OpenAI endpoint:  
     ```js
     const client = new OpenAIClient(
       process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT,
       new AzureKeyCredential(process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_KEY)
     );
     const response = await client.getCompletions("gpt-4o-mini", { prompt, maxTokens: 150 });
     ```  
   - Return `{ answer: response.choices[0].text }` in the HTTP response.  
4. **Secure & Test**  
   - Store `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` as Function App settings.  
   - Obtain the function URL (including function key) and replace `API_BASE_URL` in your `.env`.

## üì¶ Usage in Scratch

1. Start the local server (`./3-run-private.sh`) at `http://localhost:8000/`.  
2. In the Scratch¬†3.0 offline editor, go to **Experimental ‚Üí Load Unofficial Extension**.  
3. Enter your extension URL:  
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/extension.js
   ```
4. Look under **Extensions** for **‚ÄúAsk AI‚Äù**.

```scratch
when green flag clicked
ask AI [What is 2+2?] and set [Answer v]
say (Answer)
```
